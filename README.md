# About
An attempt to make a 2D MMORPG game in C++ as a kid. This is a very old, unfinished project, which I made when I was about 14 years old. It's poorly written but hey, at least it works.

The project consists of 5 sub-projects:
- Client
- Server
- Editor
- Launcher
- Updater

# Screenshots - client
