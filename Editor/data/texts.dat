21 Northern part of this town. A big L-shaped building.
22 Right in the middle of this town. I'm sure you will notice it easily.
23 Western part of this town.
24 A job? We have many problems with bandits. You can ask our chief in our headquaters.
30 Thanks.
31 Anything else?
100 Hey. What can I do for ya'?
101 Just show me what you have for sale.
102 Nothing at all. Just looking.
200 Oh, finally we've met. Welcome to our humble place, do you enjoy your stay?
201 Do we know each other?
202 I was told there's a job available here.
210 Well, we get reports about every newcomer. You know... Too many hostiles messing around, we need to make sure our citizens are safe.
211 I understand. As you've probably heard we've been having some problems with bandits for a few years now. They keep terrorizing us.
220 What can I do to help?
221 Go on...
222 And?
230 I need to make sure they won't attack our town soon. Are you interested in helping us? Someone like you would be very useful for us.
231 That's why I'm here.
232 No thanks. Maybe later.
240 They came too close to our town, go and eliminate some of them. This will scare them and prevent from attacks. They are hiding in their hideout north-west from here.
241 How much do you pay?
250 I can offer you 500$ for this task.
251 Fine.
252 Not interested. Waste of time.
300 Are you done yet?
301 Yeah
302 No, working on it.
310 Great job. That's really good to know that we have a new great soldier like you. However I have another task for you. Would you like to hear about it?
311 Of course.
312 Not now. I need to rest.
320 Ok. Come back when you are ready.
321 Bye.
330 We have recently discovered their new outpost. East from here.
331 Go on.
340 I want you to go there and kill their local leader, in return you will be paid 1000$. Are you interested?
341 Sure.
342 No thanks.
