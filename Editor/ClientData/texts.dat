0 Hey. What can I do for ya'?
1 Just show me what you have for sale.
2 Nothing at all. Just looking.
3 Oh, finally we've met. Welcome to our humble place, do you enjoy your stay?
4 Do we know each other?
5 I was told there's a job available here.
6 Well, we get reports about every newcomer. You know... Too many hostiles messing around, we need to make sure our citizens are safe.
7 What can I do to help?
8 Go on...
9 I understand. As you've probably heard we've been having some problems with bandits for a few years now. They keep terrorizing us.
10 And?
11 I need to make sure they won't attack our town soon. Are you interested in helping us? Someone like you would be very useful for us.
12 That's why I'm here.
13 No thanks. Maybe later.
14 They came too close to our town, go and eliminate some of them. This will scare them and prevent from attacks. They are hiding in their hideout north-west from here.
15 How much do you pay?
16 I can offer you 500$ for this task.
17 Fine.
18 Not interested. Waste of time.

25 Where are your headquaters?
26 Where is trade center?
27 Where can I buy equipment?
28 Where can I earn some money?
29 On the second thought, I'm fine.
30 Anything else?
31 How is this place called?
32 Where are your headquaters?

34 Where can I buy equipment?
35 Where can I earn some money?
36 Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.
37 Well, it's just a Western Outpost. I don't think it has a name though.
38 Thanks.
39 Kade town. You would have to take a boat.
40 Thanks.
41 For sure not here. I guess you should travel to Kade town as soon as you don't have any buisiness here.
42 Thanks.
43 There's a local dealer here. Eastern part of this outpost.
44 Thanks.
45 A job you say. We happen to have some problems recently. I think you should talk to our leader in our headquaters.
46 Thanks.

64 Welcome sir. I'm here to report my arrival.
65 Erhmmm, nothing. What do you want?
66 Just passing by. Good bye.
67 Is there any place here where I can arm myself?
68 Reporting back, sir.
69 Reporting back, sir.
70 Reporting back, sir.
71 There is our local dealer in eastern part of this outpost.
72 Thank you.
73 Soldier! This type of behaviour is unacceptable here!
74 Excuse me, sir.
75 I don't care.
76 I'm out of here. Bye.
77 ... so this is your first time here soldier.
78 Yes sir.
79 You are very lucky I'm not in a bad mood today. I'm done talking. Dismiss.
80 Bye.
81 Allright then. This is our Western Outpost. Our headquaters are located in Kade, however you won't be able to get there by foot. You can leave whenever you want using our boat, but we happen to have some problems here also.
82 How can I help?
83 I don't have time now. Good bye.
84 First of all, go arm yourself. Talk to our weapon dealer.
85 Got it.
86 Good. Now we can use you. Go and kill 5 bandits. They are wandering around north from here. Report back when you're done.
87 Got it.
88 You're not done yet, are you? Go and kill 5 bandits.
89 Got it.
90 Well done soldier. Report back when you are ready for your next task. Dismiss.
91 Got it.
92 Hello there.
93 I was sent here by commander.
94 I'd like to buy something.
95 Oh. Wait a moment... Here you go, take this. I guess you have to report back to commander.
96 Thanks.
97 Hello. How can I help you?
98 That's all. Good bye.
